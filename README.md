# React Flow Diagram

{{Logo}}

Batteries included React Component for renderizing, creating and editing diagrams.

{{Animation gif that shows some of the features}}

## Features

- The data is the source of truth
- Can add custom Components as entities
- Continous feedback while editing
- Configurable grid, snap to grid (or no grid at all)
- History, undo, redo; keyboard shortcuts
- Panel for adding new Entities, with drag or click
- Automatic arrow placement
- Labels for arrows

### Missing features (currently working on)

- Editable arrow labels (From the UI, you can always edit the model)
- Panning, zooming (viewport and camera as separate concepts)
- Editable arrow paths (From the UI, you can always edit the model)
- Select several entities
- Copy and paste entities
- Alignment tools

## Installation

It's easier to see the an example already working to explain what we need to add. Pull (react-flow-diagram-example)[https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example] and follow along; consider it a finished state of following these instructions. You can also use this repo as a starting point for your own implementation.

Let's assume a fresh [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (which the example is created from) strucure, then:

```
yarn add react-flow-diagram
```

And we'll also add [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for our custom entities, although this is not a requirement. You can just add classNames to elements and use regular css or any css transpilation language.

```
yarn add styled-components
```

in `/src/` we create a `/CustomDiagram/` following a standard of [Grouping by features](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-features-or-routes)

And in it we create:

* [model-example.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/model-example.js)
* [config-example.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/config-example.js)
* [index.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/index.js)
* event
  * [component.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/event/component.js)
  * [icon.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/event/icon.js)
* task
  * [component.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/task/component.js)
  * [icon.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/task/icon.js)


### [model-example.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/model-example.js)

The star of the show, the model that holds the data that will be represented as a diagram.

You don't need to conciously know the structure of the model, since you can always start a diagram via the UI, save it and resume from the UI without ever touching the model. But you may need this information for your specific use case.

The structure held in the `model` const can be defined in [flow types](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/) as (you don't really need to know flowtype to grasp this):

```
type EntityState = Array<EntityModel>;
```

model is an array with `EntityModel`s representing each entity

```
type EntityType = string;
type EntityModel = {
  id: EntityId,      // unique identifier of the Entity
  type: EntityType,  // type of entity, according to your custom entity components
  width: number,     // width
  height: number,    // height
  x: number,         // x position
  y: number,         // y position
  name: string,      // label of the entity
  linksTo?: Links,   // reference to other entities
  custom?: Object,   // custom data for you to extend functionalities
};
```

The `id` of an `EntityModel` is an `EntityId`; which is just a string

```
type EntityId = string;
```

The `linksTo` attribute is [optional](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/objects/#toc-optional-object-type-properties) (an entity may not link to anyone) and holds a `Links` type, which is an array of `Link`

```
type Links = Array<Link>;

type Link = {
  target: EntityId,      // Id of another entity which is being linked to
  edited: boolean,       // whether or not the link was autogenerated or was edited by the user
  points?: Array<Point>, // Array of points that define the position of the link
  label?: string,        // link label
  color?: string,        // link color (currently not implemented)
};
```

The `points` attribute is also optional (as well as any attribute ending with `?`) and holds an array of `Point`

```
type Point = {
  x: number,  // x position
  y: number,  // y position
};
```

Check [model-example.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/model-example.js) to see who this all pans out.


### [config-example.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/config-example.js)

In this file we have two configuration objects, `config` which deals with diagram configurations and `customEntities` which holds references to our custom components that represent each type of entity.

`config` can be defined as:

```
export type ConfigState = {
  entityTypes: ConfigEntityTypes, // Size of entities
  gridSize?: number,              // optional grid size
};
```
`ConfigEntityTypes` is an [object being used as a Map](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/objects/#toc-objects-as-maps) whose keys reference the types of entities.

```
export type ConfigEntityTypes = {
  [EntityType]: {
    width: number,
    height: number,
  },
};
```

It's recommended to find an entitiy size that is a multiple of the grid size; however you're free to choose any positive `number`.

`customEntities` can be defined as:

```
type CustomEntities = {
  [EntityType]: {
    component: ComponentType<DiagComponentProps>,
    icon: {
      path: Element<*>,
      size: number,
    },
  },
};
```

The `component` attribute holds a reference to a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) that will be provided `DiagComponentProps` props. The creation of your custom components is covered in {{TODO: Link to create custom entitiy components section}}

```
export type DiagComponentProps = {
  model: EntityModel,
  meta: MetaEntityModel,
  setName: SetNamePayload => EntityAction,
};
```

You can use this props to get information about the component, and `setName` method to change the name of the component.

We referenced `EntityModel` before, and `MetaEntityModel` can be defined as:

```
type MetaEntityModel = {
  id: EntityId,
  isAnchored: boolean,
  isSelected: boolean,
};
```

Which is information that only matters while interacting with the components on the UI. You wouldn't need to save this information. A [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) [Entity component](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram/blob/master/src/entity/component.js) will deal about positioning, selection, context menus and more for you, so you just need to focus on the specific features of your custom Entity.


### [index.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/index.js)

On index we define our custom Component that initializes seting throguh `componentWillMount` and passes `customEntities` to the `Diagram` Component

```
import React from 'react';
import {
  Diagram,
  store as diagramStore,
  setEntities,
  setConfig,
  diagramOn,
} from 'react-flow-diagram';
import model from './model-example';
import { config, customEntities } from './config-example';

class CustomDiagram extends React.PureComponent {
  componentWillMount() {
    diagramStore.dispatch(setConfig(config));
    diagramStore.dispatch(setEntities(model));

    diagramOn('anyChange', entityState =>
      // You can get the model back
      // after modifying the UI representation
      console.info(entityState)
    );
  }
  render() {
    return <Diagram customEntities={customEntities} />;
  }
}

export default CustomDiagram;
```

We dispatch a `setConfig` and `setEntities` action to the `diagramStore`, and on `anyChange` we can get a hold of our modified `entityState`

### event and task folders

We'll cover this in the next section:

## Creating our own Entities

This component does not come with any custom entities, and you must create your own. However on (react-flow-diagram-example)[https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/] we have two examples of custom entities, namely (task)[https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/tree/master/src/CustomDiagram/task] and (event)[https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/tree/master/src/CustomDiagram/event].

Let's take a look at the task entitiy as an example.

In the [task folder](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/tree/master/src/CustomDiagram/task) we see two files:

* [component.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/task/component.js)
* [icon.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/react-flow-diagram-example/blob/master/src/CustomDiagram/task/icon.js)

Let's start with...
