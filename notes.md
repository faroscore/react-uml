# Things I have to take into account related to the panning-zooming thing

- [x] Model representation: How will I represent Canvas position inside CanvasViewport, How will I represent zoom
- [x] Canvas itself: How will it "grow" to show more or less space
    Ok... mi idea es que... tenemos dos cosas: El viewport... o viewfinder? a ver

- [ ] Mouse position mapping
- [x] Mouse handling: Related to canvas dealing already with mouse position, I should probably use this data for everything
- [ ] User events: How will users change panning and zooming
